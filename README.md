# UC ITPS .NET Developers Identity Story

The Microsoft Identity story has evolved over the years since the release of the Membership Provider in .NET 2.0. In this session we explore how the identity story in .NET has evolved from early days of username/password to working with integrated and 3rd party identity providers. We will talk about what's new and how to implement basic identity with the tools available to the developer.

## Demos
1. Default Identity
2. Scaffolding and Multifactor Auth
3. 3rd Party Identity Providers
4. Authorization
